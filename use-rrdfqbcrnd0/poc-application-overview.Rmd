# Setup

The mermaid package included in DiagrammeR is used for drawing the flowcharts.
See (http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/graphviz_and_mermaid.html), (http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/#flowcharts-basic-syntax)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# install.packages(c("DiagrammeR","DiagrammeRsvg"))
library("DiagrammeR")
library("DiagrammeRsvg")
library("htmltools")
```

Note: pdf generation does not work yet.

#Application process

Here is a high level overview of the proof of concept package

```{r pocdiag, echo=FALSE}
mermaid("
graph TB
subgraph ADAM data
A(ADAM)
end

subgraph Analysis results to RDF
A-->B[Analyse]
B-->C(Analysis Results as .csv)
C-->D[Convert to RDF datacube]
D-->E(Analysis Resuls as .ttl)
end

subgraph Analysis results to RDF
A-->gA[Convert using D2RQ as .ttl]
gA-->aB(ADAM as .ttl)
end

subgraph Servering RDF
aB-->F
E-->F[SPARQL endpoint]
end

subgraph Presentation of results
F-->pA[Reporting]
pA-->pB(Tables as .html)
end

subgraph Servering HTML
pB-->pC[Webserver]
end

subgraph PoC Application
aF(.html and .js)-->pC
aG(configuration as .ttl)-->F
end

subgraph Browser
pC-->aA
F-->aA[Application]
end
")
```

Note: export_svg does not work for now.
